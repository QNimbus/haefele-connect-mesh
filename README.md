A Home Assistant custom integration for HÃ¤fele Connect Mesh devices. This integration allows you to control HÃ¤fele smart devices through Home Assistant.

## Update (04-12-2024) ðŸŽŠ

I'm excited to share some great news regarding the HÃ¤fele Connect Mesh integration! Recently, I had the opportunity to connect with HÃ¤fele, and I'm delighted to report that they are not only aware of this project but are also highly supportive of Open Source Initiative (OSI) principles and open-source development as a whole. HÃ¤fele recognizes the importance of community-driven platforms like Home Assistant and is eager to see seamless integrations that benefit both their customers and the broader open-source community.

To support the development and testing of this integration, HÃ¤fele has generously provided me with a selection of their hardware. This will enable me to expand the capabilities of the HÃ¤fele Home Assistant integration and ensure broader compatibility with their product lineup.

You can expect to see more features, enhanced stability, and support for additional HÃ¤fele devices in the coming months as I put this hardware to work. Stay tuned for updates!

## Supported Devices

Currently, this integration has been tested with:
- HÃ¤fele LED lights (dimmable)
- Power socket (HÃ¤fele, LEDVance or Jung)

While the integration includes support for color temperature and RGB/HSL capable lights, as well as other device types (switches, sensors, etc.), these features are currently **untested** as I don't have access to these device types.

## Prerequisites
